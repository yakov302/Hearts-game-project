1. Creates a memory allocation for structure that contains objects that managing the memory allocation.
2. creates memory allocation for array of int.
3.insert values to the structure elements of the structure:
*m_items: Pointer to the array
m_originalSize:Array size, comes as input - first parameter in the function.
m_size: Array size, comes as input - first parameter in the function.
m_nItems: size of the array increases (if necessary) comes as input - the second parameter in the function.
m_blockSize: The number of members in the array. gets the value 0.

input parameters:
_initialSize: Array size.
_extensionBlockSize:Size of the array increases (if necessary).

output parameter:
NULL: if the array size and the array increases size is equal to 0 or if the memory allocation to the structure or array failed.
ptr: pointer to the structure if the allocations were made successfully.*/

Release allocation of the array and the structure.

input parameters:
*_vector: pointer to the structure.

output parameter:
ERR_NOT_INITIALIZED: if the *_vector pointer is equal to NUUL.
ERR_OK: if the allocation released done successfully*/

/*VectorAdd function description:
1. checks if the size of elements (m_nItems) is smaller than the size allocated to the array, and if is smaller, insert "_item" to the array and increases the number of elements (m_nItems) by 1;
2. if number of elements (m_nItems) equal to the array size allocation, the function:
re-allocates the size and saves it in a temporary pointer "temp".
if the allocation is performed successfully:
the new pointer is inserted into the original pointer "m_items".
the new size is inserted into the size variable "m_size".
"_item" insert to the array.
number of elements (m_nItems)increases the by 1.

input parameters:
*_vector: pointer to the structure.
_item: the value that needs to enter the array.

output parameter:
NERR_NOT_INITIALIZED: if the *_vector pointer is equal to NUUL or if the re-allocation failed (return NULL).
ERR_OVERFLOW: if re-allocation is needed and the size of array increasesis (m_blockSize) equal to 0.
OK: if the value of "_item" variable enters the array*/

insert the last member in the array into pointer "_item" and decrease the number of elements(m_nItems) by 1.

input parameters:

*_item: pointer to "_item" variable, the last element of the array will be inserted into it.

output parameter:

ERR_UNDERFLOW: If the number of elements (m_nItems) is 0.

insert the number of elements in the array into the variable _numOfltems.

input parameters:

output parameter:

output parameter:
